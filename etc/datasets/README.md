# DocRED

DocRED (Document-Level Relation Extraction Dataset) is a relation extraction dataset constructed from Wikipedia and Wikidata. Each document
in the dataset is human-annotated with named entity mentions, coreference information, intra- and inter-sentence relations, and supporting
evidence. DocRED requires reading multiple sentences in a document to extract entities and infer their relations by synthesizing all
information of the document. Along with the human-annotated data, the dataset provides large-scale distantly supervised data.

DocRED contains 132,375 entities and 56,354 relational facts annotated on 5,053 Wikipedia documents. In addition to the human-annotated
data, the dataset provides large-scale distantly supervised data over 101,873 documents.

# Tacred

TACRED is a large-scale relation extraction dataset with 106,264 examples built over newswire and web text from the corpus used in the
yearly TAC Knowledge Base Population (TAC KBP) challenges. Examples in TACRED cover 41 relation types as used in the TAC KBP challenges
(e.g., per:schools_attended and org:members) or are labeled as no_relation if no defined relation is held. These examples are created by
combining available human annotations from the TAC KBP challenges and crowdsourcing.
